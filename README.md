## 使用指南

### 从延河课堂获取密钥

我们非常重视您的账户安全。如果您完全信任本服务，可以直接通过 BIT 统一身份认证 (SSO) 登录。作为替代方案，如果您希望避免直接输入密码，可以先登录“延河课堂”官网，然后使用我们的书签工具提取访问密钥。在密钥有效期内，此操作只需执行一次。

> **提示：**
> - 在 iOS Safari 上，按住并拖动“获取延河课堂密钥”按钮，保持手指按住不放，用另一只手轻点屏幕底部的“书本”图标，在新打开的书签栏页面，将按钮拖放到你想要的位置；
> - 在桌面浏览器上，按下 Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+B 显示书签栏。

### 输入您的密钥

将从延河课堂复制的密钥粘贴到下面的输入框中。我们绝不会在服务器上储存您的账户、密码或任何个人身份信息。

### 观看直播课程

要查看您本学期注册的课程，请查看个人直播列表；要查看当前时段全校的直播课程，请切换到全校直播列表。您还可以输入关键词搜索想要观看的课程。

### 启用幻灯片自动提取

选择观看屏幕录制时，可启用幻灯片自动提取功能。在移动设备上启用此功能时，需保持浏览器标签页为活跃状态并置于前台。

> **提示：** 在 iOS Safari 上，切换应用、锁定屏幕可能导致幻灯片提取中止，您可以进入全屏或画中画播放模式并关闭自动锁屏。

### 管理您的已储存幻灯片

幻灯片会保存在您浏览器的本地数据库中，点击“查看已储存幻灯片”可进行管理。

> **提示：**
> - 若在直播页面下载失败，您可返回此处查看并下载所有已储存的幻灯片；
> - 若本地数据库出现索引错误，可尝试通过“清理所有数据”功能进行修复。
